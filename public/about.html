		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I am an incredibly curious multi-passionate person whose 		eyes for novelty are sometimes bigger than my stomach. I 		love trying new things, ending up in new places, and 		starting new hobbies.</p>

		<p>On this website, you will find the fruits of my latest 		passion, web development. I studied Computer Science in 		college, but because I am more of a scientist of people 		than binary numbers, I opted to get my minor in it. Over a 		decade later, I decided to revisit coding one more time, 		just to see if I really didn't like it, or my environment 		in college had tainted my view of it.</p>

		<p>So far, so good! Join me as I engage with my coding, and 		other projects. I can't wait to share my journey with you!		</p>
